## Setup & Local Development (Optional but Recommended)

This project uses simple HTML, CSS (compiled from SCSS), and JavaScript, relying on VS Code extensions for local development. Node.js/npm is not required for basic setup.

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BIWizzard/resume_2025.git
    cd resume_2025
    ```
2.  **Install VS Code Extensions (if not already installed):**
    *   `ritwickdey.live-sass` (Live Sass Compiler)
    *   `ritwickdey.LiveServer` (Live Server)
3.  **Compile SCSS:**
    *   Open `scss/main.scss` in VS Code.
    *   Click "Watch Sass" in the VS Code status bar (or configure auto-compile in VS Code settings). This will generate `css/main.css`.
4.  **Run Live Server:**
    *   Right-click on `index.html` in the VS Code explorer.
    *   Select "Open with Live Server".

## Deployment

This is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Deployment involves uploading the project files (primarily `index.html`, the `css` folder, `images` folder, `doc` folder, and potentially the `js` folder) to a web host capable of serving static content (e.g., shared hosting, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3).

*Auto-deployed on Hostinger.com via GitHub*
